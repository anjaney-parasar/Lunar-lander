# Lunar Lander Deep Q-Learning 🚀

Welcome to the Lunar Lander Deep Q-Learning project, where we leverage the power of Deep Q-Learning and the Stable Baselines library to train an agent capable of landing a spacecraft on the moon! 🌕🚀

## Overview 📖

In this project, we tackle the challenging Lunar Lander environment using reinforcement learning techniques. Our agent learns to navigate the lunar landscape, adjusting thrusters to achieve a smooth and safe landing. We employ Deep Q-Learning, a powerful algorithm that combines deep neural networks with Q-learning, to enable our agent to make intelligent decisions in a complex and dynamic environment.
